<Info description="PMSM drive using imported FEM data and optimized Field-Oriented Control (FOC), with supporting design scripts that:&#xa;1. Determine open-loop frequency response and check stability margins. This requires Simulink® Control Design™, using the Frequency Response Estimator block.&#xa;2. Determine the optimal d-axis and q-axis currents that minimize overall motor losses when delivering a commanded torque and speed.&#xa;&#xa;The Electric Drive is implemented using:&#xa;1. A detailed Simscape™ Electrical™ nonlinear motor model in the form of tabulated flux linkages and Steinmetz coefficients.  &#xa;2. A Field-Oriented Controller (FOC) that has been optimized to minimize motor losses.&#xa;" />
