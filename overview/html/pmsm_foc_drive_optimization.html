Determine open-loop frequency response and check stability margins. This requires Simulink&reg; Control Design, using the Frequency Response Estimator block. 2. Determine the optimum d-axis and q-axis currents that minimize overall motor losses when delivering a commanded torque and speed. The Electric Drive is implemented using: 1. A detailed nonlinear motor model in the form of tabulated flux linkages and Steinmetz coefficients. 2. A Field-Oriented Controller (FOC) that has been optimized to minimize motor losses.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">System Model</a></li><li><a href="#2">Model</a></li><li><a href="#3">Inverter Model</a></li><li><a href="#4">Field-Oriented Controller</a></li><li><a href="#5">Plot Losses With Original Controller</a></li><li><a href="#6">Optimize Controller to Minimize Losses</a></li><li><a href="#7">%% Plot Losses With Optimal Controller</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="1">System Model</h2><h2 id="2">Model</h2><pre class="codeinput">model = <span class="string">'pmsm_foc_drive'</span>;

%% PMSM Drive Using Field-Oriented Control
% 
% This example models an electric drive with supporting design scripts that:
% 1. Determine open-loop frequency response and check stability margins. This requires Simulink® Control Design, using the Frequency Response Estimator block.
% 2. Determine the optimum d-axis and q-axis currents that minimize overall motor losses when delivering a commanded torque and speed.
% The Electric Drive is implemented using:
% 1. A detailed nonlinear motor model in the form of tabulated flux linkages and Steinmetz coefficients.
% 2. A Field-Oriented Controller (FOC) that has been optimized to minimize motor losses.
